# Guard-Defense-2021-22
Analyzing NBA Guard Defenders Using 538's RAPTOR defensive metric. 
This project was originally done with the Denver Nugget's offseason in mind. Meant to adress a glaring defensive hole for the team. Through analayzing Raptor and contract deals to narrow down the best candidates.
Based on our analysis the best candidate that fits financially and defensively is Alex Caruso (I still feel this way to this day).
